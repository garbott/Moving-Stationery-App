# Moving Stationery App

Moving Stationery is a Vue 3 + Vite multi-page experience powered by Vue Router. It includes dedicated routes for the home hero, services overview, brand kit (logo + palette), and a contact/booking hub.

## Local development

1. `cd app`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev`

The dev server runs at `http://localhost:5173/` by default. Update layout/navigation inside `src/App.vue`, page content inside `src/pages/`, and global styling in `src/style.css`. Add new routes through `src/router/index.js`.
